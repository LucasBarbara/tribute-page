        <p id="intro">Marie Curie was a French-Polish physicist and chemist known by her pioneering research on radioactivity. She discovered the elements radium and polonium and helped fight against cancer. Her lifetime work granted her numerous awards including a nobel prize, the first of his kind to be awarded to a woman.</p>

        <p>Marie was born in Warsaw, 5th child of an impoverished family. Growing up, she wanted to pursuit higher education studies which were, at the time, not available for women in Poland. Despite this unfavorable beginning, she grew to become one of the most important scientists of her time</p>

        <p>Marie was the first person and only woman to win a nobel twice and is the only person that has won a nobel in two different sciences. During her career, she published numerous papers alone and together with her husband and was the first woman to be a professor at the University of Paris. Her many achievements include the development of the theory of radiation, the founding of the Radium Institute of the University of Paris and the Curie Institutes in Paris and Warsaw.</p>
